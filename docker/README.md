## Trip Segmentation Count
How many trips occurred within different distance segments in October 2019?

Query: 

SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN trip_distance <= 1 THEN 'Up to 1 mile'
    WHEN trip_distance > 1 AND trip_distance <= 3 THEN '1-3 miles'
    WHEN trip_distance > 3 AND trip_distance <= 7 THEN '3-7 miles'
    WHEN trip_distance > 7 AND trip_distance <= 10 THEN '7-10 miles'
    ELSE 'Over 10 miles'
  END AS distance_levels,

#Terraform Workflow
 To prepare an environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.
 the sequence to : 
Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend  terraform init,  
Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan ...terraform apply -auto-approve,
